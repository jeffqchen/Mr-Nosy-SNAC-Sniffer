# Mr Nosy SNAC Sniffer

<img src="./Pics/long.png">

”Mr. Nosy“” SNAC Sniffer is a hardware iteration that's powered by the [RetroSpy](https://github.com/retrospy/RetroSpy).

I've created two versions. One with the impression of an inline design, while the other can be set up to hide the wires behind it.

## Assembly

Assembly is pretty straight forward. Parts belong to the side with silkscreen printings.

Note on the long version, the two HDMI headers are on different sides. Remember to solder the jumper headers before soldering the Arduino socket, otherwise it will be kind of hard to do afterwards.
