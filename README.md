# Mr Nosy SNAC Sniffer

<img src="./Pics/long.png">

”Mr. Nosy“” SNAC Sniffer is a hardware iteration that's powered by the [RetroSpy](https://github.com/retrospy/RetroSpy).

I've created three versions. The long with the impression of an inline design. The square can be set up to hide the wires behind it. The "L" is a shorter & more compact design of the long.

## Assembly

Assembly is pretty straight forward. Parts belong to the side with silkscreen printings.

Note on the long version, the two HDMI headers are on different sides. Remember to solder the jumper headers before soldering the Arduino or its socket, otherwise it will be kind of hard to do afterwards.
